# PasswordGeneratorServer

This project works with PasswordGeneratorClient, that simulate a modified OTP lamport algorith, to autheticate users with token. The server part is to authenticate the tokens generated in PasswordGenetorClient.
To use the project, in server_resources.txt, replace the hash strings with password/user desire. Remember that the user, seed and salt must be the same used in PasswordGeneratorClient.

The code can be founded in master branch, I'm too lazy to change it, sorry.
